<h3>Handin procedure</h3>

<div class="important">
<p>
Before submitting, please run all tests one final time.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Use the <tt>make lab<i>n</i><i>p</i></tt> command to package your lab assignment and upload it
to the class's submission website, located at
<a href="https://6824.scripts.mit.edu/2022/handin.py/">https://6824.scripts.mit.edu/2022/handin.py/</a>.
<i>n</i> is the lab number (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 4) and <i>p</i> the part
(e.g, A, B, or C), if the lab is in parts.

<p>For example:
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.824
$ echo XXX &gt; api.key
$ make lab1
</pre>

Or:
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.824
$ echo XXX &gt; api.key
$ make lab2b
</pre>


<p>If you submit a latter part, make sure the earlier parts still work.
That is run, all tests through the part you are submitting.
</p>

<p>
You may use your MIT Certificate or request an API key via
email to log in for the first time. Your API key (<tt>XXX</tt>)
is displayed once you logged in, which can be used to upload
lab1 from the console as follows.
</p>

<p class="important">
Check the submission website to make sure it thinks you submitted this lab!
</p>

<p class="note">
You may submit multiple times. We will use the timestamp of
your <strong>last</strong> submission for the purpose of
calculating late days. Your grade is determined by the score
your solution <strong>reliably</strong> achieves when we run
the tester on our test machines.

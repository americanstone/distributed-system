<h1>Question and Answer Session</h1>

<p>Submit a question about one of the previous labs (i.e., one you
  already submitted): for example, something you wondered about while
  doing the lab, something you didn't understand, or just anything.

<p>Upload your question as sq{lecture number}.txt. To the extent
  possible, during lecture we will try to answer questions submitted
  the evening before. In lecture we will also discuss our solutions.

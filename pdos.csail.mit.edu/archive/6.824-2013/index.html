<H4>What is 6.824 about?</H4>

<p>6.824 is a core 12-unit graduate subject
with lectures, readings, programming labs, a mid-term quiz, a final exam, and
an open-ended project. It will present abstractions and implementation
techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major topics include
fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class
consists of studying and discussing case studies of distributed
systems.


<p> Prerequisites: 6.004 and one of <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www">6.033</A> or <a
href="../../6.828/2021/index.html">6.828<a>, or equivalent.
Substantial programming experience will be helpful for the
lab assignments and final project.</p>

<p>If you feel you know enough about systems engineering, an
alternative subject to 6.824 is <a
href="http://nms.csail.mit.edu/6.829">6.829</a>.  6.829 focuses on the
engineering of networks.  If you are a graduate student in systems or
networking, we recommend you take both classes during your graduate
career.
If you want to learn more about operating systems in particular,
you should consider <a
href="../../6.828/2021/index.html">6.828</a>.</p>

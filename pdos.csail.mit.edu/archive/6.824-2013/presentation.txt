Thursday May 16 from 12:30 to 3:00 we will have in-class project
presentations.

If you can make it before 1:00 or after 2:30, please sign up for one
of those slots, to leave room for people who have to be somewhere
else.

You'll have 5 minutes to present. Please practice to make sure you fit
in the time limit. We will cut you off after 5 minutes.

You should explain what you did for your project, and what was most
interesting about it, before diving into a demo. It's probably best
not to use PowerPoint except if you need to present graphics
(diagrams, performance graphs, &c). It's great if you can show a demo
of your system in action, but that's not required. It's best if the
person operating the demo does not talk; have one person at the
computer, and another speaking.

We'll have two projectors/screens set up, and groups will alternate,
to give each group time to set up. If you plan to use a projector,
please make sure in advance that you know how to get your laptop to
talk to a projector. Please make sure your laptop is running all the
right software &c before it's your turn to present. Be prepared for
the possibility that your demo might not work, or that the wireless
network might be slow.

Please be in 32-144 and ready to start promptly at 12:30pm.
